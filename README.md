## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

| Feature                | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **‚öôÔ∏è Architecture**     | The codebase follows the modular structure of Angular, separating components, services, pipes, and modules. It uses Angular's platformBrowserDynamic to bootstrap the application module. It also implements routes for different pages/components. The codebase demonstrates a model-view-controller (MVC) architecture.    |
| **üìñ Documentation**   | The documentation is rudimentary, primarily consisting of inline comments in the codebase. There is no separate documentation file or detailed explanation of functionality or usage. Improving the documentation would be beneficial for newcomers and future contributors.    |
| **üîó Dependencies**    | The codebase heavily relies on Angular and its related libraries. These include Angular modules for browser compatibility, routing, and HTTP communication. Authentication and API access are managed through external libraries or mechanisms, which are not specified in the provided information.    |
| **üß© Modularity**      | The codebase demonstrates modularity through the organization of components and modules. Each component is created independently, making it easier to manage and reusability is emphasized. Furthermore, services encapsulate logic and interact with other components. Improvements can be made by adhering to additional SOLID principles.    |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Testing**          | `<app-home>` component, `<capitalize>` pipe, `<relative-time>` pipe, `<sort>` pipe, `<to-currency>` pipe, and `<truncate>` pipe have unit tests using Angular's testing framework. Significant testing coverage would include testing services and UI components to ensure comprehensive test coverage, and the use of CI/CD tools and test automation for efficiency.    |
| **‚ö°Ô∏è Performance**      | Without a comprehensive analysis and performance testing, it is difficult to gauge the codebase's performance. However, Angular's framework architecture and proper handling of API requests are favorable for optimizing performance. Always consider implementing performance optimizations such as lazy loading, code splitting, and caching.    |
| **üîê Security**        | The codebase emphasizes security by utilizing Angular's built-in mechanisms such as authentication and authorization. However, specific implementation details related to security measures are not fully explained in the provided information. Further examination and assessment may be necessary to ensure robust security measures.    |
| **üîÄ Version Control** | The codebase is stored and version-controlled using Git. From the provided information, it is observed that the codebase is hosted on GitHub. However, the information does not detail the actual version control practices, branching strategies, or any relevant CI/CD practices adopted in this repo.    |
| **üîå Integrations**    | The codebase integrates with other systems or APIs, but the details of these integrations are not provided. The use of services and API endpoints suggests that the codebase relies on external integrations or microservices for specific functionality. Implementing clear documentation about these integrations would be essential for improved understanding and maintenance by developers.    |
| **üì∂ Scalability**     | The codebase's modularity and adherence to Angular's best practices prove beneficial for scalability. However, without further details, it is challenging to assess if the scaling concerns of the system, such as large data sets, concurrent
